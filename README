I wanted to move some experimental code I had written in past in to remote repository. The example code refers to possible solutions to below problems:

1) Key Counts

Write a function that sums up keys in a text file. The file contains data in the format of

"key,count" where key is a string and count is an integer. Each line will only contain one key-count pair. The output should contain each key occurring in the file along with the sum of the count for all occurrences of a given key.

For Example:

John,2

Jane,3

John,4

Jane,5

Would result in the output: "The total for John is 6. The total for Jane is 8."


2) Palindrome Detection

Write a function that determines if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled exactly the same forwards or backwards, like "pop" or "Ah, Satan sees Natasha". For this question, ignore all non-alphanumeric characters and assume that upper-and lower-case characters are identical. The function should output whether or not the string is a palindrome and return a boolean.

3. Print the depth of a document containing nested label and URL. I haven't tested this solution and dont remember when I wrote it.
